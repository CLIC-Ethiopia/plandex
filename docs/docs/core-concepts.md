# Core Concepts

## Plans and Context

Plandex uses plans to manage tasks and context. A plan is a set of files and directories that are loaded into the AI's context. You can create a new plan with `plandex new` and load context with `plandex load`.

## Branches and Rewind

Plandex supports branches and rewinding to previous states. You can create a new branch with `plandex checkout` and rewind to a previous state with `plandex rewind`.

## Managing Changes

Plandex allows you to review and manage changes before applying them to your project files. You can view changes with `plandex changes` and apply them with `plandex apply`.

## Model Settings

Plandex supports a wide range of models and allows you to customize model settings. You can view current model settings with `plandex models` and update them with `plandex set-model`.
