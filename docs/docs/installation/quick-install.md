# Quick Install

To quickly install Plandex, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
curl -sL https://plandex.ai/install.sh | bash
```

This command will download and install the latest version of Plandex.

## Verify Installation

After installation, you can verify that Plandex is installed correctly by running:

```bash
plandex --version
```

You should see the version number of Plandex printed in the terminal.

## Using the `pdx` Alias

For convenience, you can use the `pdx` alias instead of typing `plandex` for every command. The alias is automatically set up during installation.

```bash
pdx --version
```

This should also print the version number of Plandex.
