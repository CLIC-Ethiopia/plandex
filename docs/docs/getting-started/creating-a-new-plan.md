# Creating a New Plan

To create a new plan in your project's root directory, use the `plandex new` command:

```bash
plandex new
```

This command will start a new plan and set it as the current plan.

## Naming Your Plan

You can also give your plan a name up front:

```bash
plandex new -n my-plan
```

If you don't provide a name, the plan will be named 'draft' until you give it a task.

## Verifying the Current Plan

To see the current plan, use the `plandex current` command:

```bash
plandex current
```

This will display the name and details of the current plan.
