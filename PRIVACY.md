## Plandex privacy and data retention üõ°Ô∏è

Data you send to Plandex Cloud is retained in order to debug and improve Plandex. In the future, this data may also be used to train and fine-tune models to improve performance.

That said, if you delete a plan or delete your account, all associated data will be removed from the database. It will still be included in database backups for up to 7 days, then it will no longer exist anywhere on our servers.

If you self-host Plandex, no data will be sent to Plandex Cloud.

Data sent to a model provider like OpenAI is subject to the model provider's privacy and data retention policies.
