## 🌟 Build large features and entire projects with AI.

🔮 Plandex is an open source, terminal-based **AI programming engine** with long-running agents, automatic file updates, versioning, branches, and diff review.

🔄 Enables a **tight feedback loop** between programmer and AI.

🏋️ Helps you churn through your backlog, work with unfamiliar technologies, get unstuck, and spend less time on tedious tasks. **Makes programming more fun.**

🧠 Relies on the **OpenAI API** and requires an `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable. Support for Open Source models, Google Gemini, and Anthropic Claude is coming soon.

✅ **Supports Mac, Linux, and Windows** (Windows supported via [Git bash](https://gitforwindows.org) or [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about)). Runs from a single binary with no dependencies. Small, fast, and efficient. Works with any programming language, framework, or technology.

## Install 📥

curl -s https://plandex.ai/install.sh | bash

## Get started 🚀

```
export OPENAI_API_KEY=...
plandex new
```

You can also use the `pdx` alias instead of `plandex` if you like:

```
pdx new
```

After any plandex command is run, additional commands that could make sense to run next will be suggested.

To see all available commands, run:

```
plandex help
```

For help on any command, run:

```
plandex [command] --help
```

## About the developer 👋

Hi, I'm Dane. I've been building and launching software products for 17 years. I went through YCombinator in winter 2018 with my devops security company, EnvKey, which I continue to run today. I'm fascinated by LLMs and their potential to transform the practice of software development.

I live with my wife and 4 year old daughter on the SF peninsula in California. I grew up in the Finger Lakes region of upstate New York. I like reading fiction, listening to podcasts, fitness, and surfing. I started Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu recently and am pretty absorbed with that these days as well.

## Possible co-founder? 😎

I'm looking for a technical co-founder or two with experience in some combination of Golang|Devops|TypeScript|AI to help me get Plandex off the ground as an open source project, a product, and a fun, WFH-friendly company. If you're interested, please reach out or jump in and start contributing.

## Possible employee? 👩‍💻

While I'm not currently hiring for Plandex, I hope to in the future. If you're an experienced Golang or TypeScript engineer and are interested in working remotely on Plandex for a salary at some point with a group of smart, nice, and fun people, please reach out or jump in and start contributing.

## Possible investor? 💰

I'd love for Plandex's users and contributors to own a significant share of the cap table. Please reach out if you're an angel investor and are interested in investing.
