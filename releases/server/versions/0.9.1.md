- Added an auto-verify and auto-fix step to plan builds to improve reliability and reduce syntax errors, mistaken duplication or removal of code, and other similar issues.

- Fix for 'exit status 128' errors in a couple of edge case scenarios.
- Data that is piped into `plandex load` is now automatically given a name.
