##   ☄️  🌅   It's a new era for AI driven development: gpt-4o is the real deal for coding agents

- gpt-4o, OpenAI's latest model, is the new default model for Plandex. 4o offers a step-wise improvement over gpt-4-turbo for coding tasks and agent-based workflows. Another level of capabilities is now achievable.
- If you have not used `plandex set-model` or `plandex set-model default` previously to set a custom model, you will now be use gpt-4o by default. If you *have* used one of those commands, use `plandex set-model` or `plandex set-model default` and select the new `gpt-4o-latest` model-pack to upgrade. 
 
##   🛰️  🏥   Major reliability improvements: 90% reduction in errors 

- Automatic syntax and logic validation with an auto-correction step for file updates.
- Significantly improves reliability and reduces syntax errors, mistaken duplication or removal of code, placeholders that reference other code and other similar issues. 
- With a set of ~30 internal evals spanning 5 common languages, syntax errors were reduced by over 90% on average with gpt-4o. 
- Logical errors are also drastically reduced (I'm still working on evals for those to get more precise numbers).
- Plandex is now much better at handling larger files and plans that make many updates to the same file. These could be problematic in previous versions.
- If you tried Plandex previously but found it too error-prone, I'd recommend giving it another shot. With gpt-4o and auto-correction, it's a new ballgame.

##   🧠  🚞   Major improvements to core planning engine: better memory and less laziness allow you to accomplish larger and more complex tasks without errors or stopping early

- Plandex is now much better at working through long plans without skipping tasks, repeating tasks it's already done, or otherwise losing track of what it's doing.
- Plandex is much less likely to leave TODO placeholders in comments instead of fully completing a task, or to otherwise leave a task incomplete.
- Plandex is much less likely to end a plan before all tasks are completed.

##   🏎️  📈   Major performance improvements: 2x faster planning and execution

- gpt-4o is twice as fast as gpt-4-turbo for planning, summarization, builds, and more.
- If you find it's streaming too fast and you aren't able to review the output, try using the `--stop / -s` flag with `plandex tell` or `plandex continue`. It will stop the plan after a single response so you can review it before proceeding. Use `plandex continue` to proceed with the plan once you're ready.
- Speaking of which, if you're in exploratory mode and want to use less tokens, you can also use the `--no-build / -n` flag with `plandex tell` and `plandex continue`. This prevents Plandex from building files until you run `plandex build` manually.

##   💰  🪙   2x cost reduction: gpt-4o is half the per-token price of gpt-4-turbo

- For the same quantity of output, with improved quality and 2x speed, you'll pay roughly half-price. Not too shabby.
