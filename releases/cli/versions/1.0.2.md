- Give notes added to context with `plandex load -n 'some note'` an auto-generated name in the `context ls` list.
- Added a `--plain / -p` flag to `plandex convo` that outputs the conversation in plain text with no ANSI codes.
- `plandex convo` now accepts a message number or range of messages to display (e.g. `plandex convo 1`, `plandex convo 1-5`, `plandex convo 2-`). Use `plandex convo 1` to show the initial prompt.
- Remove 'gpt-4-turbo-preview' from list of built-in models and model packs
- Better help text if `plandex load` is run with incorrect arguments
- `plandex rm` can now accept a range of indices to remove (e.g. `plandex rm 1-5`)
- Non-OpenAI models can now be used for *all* roles, including the builder, verifier, and auto-fix roles, since streaming function calls are no longer required for these roles.
- Fix for `plandex load` issue loading paths that begin with `./`
- Fixes for some occasional rendering issues when streaming plans and build counts
- Fix for `plandex set-model` model selection showing built-in model options that aren't compatible with the selected role--now only compatible models are shown
