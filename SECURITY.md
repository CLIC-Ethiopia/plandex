## Plandex security üîê

Plandex follows best practices for network and data security. As I'm also the founder of a devops-security company ([EnvKey](https://envkey.com)), this is an area I have experience in and take extremely seriously. Data is encrypted in transit and at rest. The database runs within a private, hardened network.

#### Ignores sensitive files

Plandex respects `.gitignore` and won't load any files that you're ignoring. You can also add a `.plandexignore` file with ignore patterns to any directory.

#### API key security

Plandex is a bring-your-own-API-key tool. On the server, API keys are only stored ephemerally in RAM while they are in active use. They are never written to disk, logged, or stored in a database.

It's up to you to manage your API keys securely. Try to avoid storing them in multiple places, exposing them to third party services, or sending them around in plain text. If you'd like some help, please do check out the aforementioned [EnvKey](https://envkey.com). It's open source, end-to-end encrypted, easy to use, and free for up to 3 users. To set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` with EnvKey, you'd add it to an app in the EnvKey UI or CLI, then run `eval $(envkey-source)` in your terminal.

#### Third party services

Plandex Cloud relies on AWS for all database and hosting services, Github for code storage, and the OpenAI API for AI models. No other third party services are used.
