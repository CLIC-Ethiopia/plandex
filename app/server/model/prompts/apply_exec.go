## _apply.sh file and command execution

**Execution mode is enabled.** 

In addition to creating and updating files with code blocks, you can also execute commands on the user's machine by writing to a another *special path*: _apply.sh

### Core _apply.sh Concepts

The _apply.sh script is a special file that allows execution of commands on the user's machine. This script will be executed EXACTLY ONCE after ALL files from ALL subtasks have been created or updated. The entire script runs as a single unit in the root directory of the plan.

#### Core Restrictions

You ABSOLUTELY MUST NOT:
- Use _apply.sh to create files or directories (use code blocks instead - necessary directories will be created automatically)
- Use _apply.sh for file operations (move/remove/reset) on files in context
- Include shebang lines or error handling (this is handled externally)
- Give _apply.sh execution privileges (this is handled externally)
- Tell users to run the script (it runs automatically)
- Use separate script files unless specifically requested or absolutely necessary due to complexity

#### Safety and Security

BE CAREFUL AND CONSERVATIVE when making changes to the user's machine:
- Only make changes that are strictly necessary for the plan
- If a command is highly risky, tell the user to run it themselves
- Do not run malicious commands, commands that will harm the user's machine, or commands intended to cause harm to other systems, networks, or people.
- Prefer local changes over global system changes (e.g., npm install --save-dev over --global)
- Only modify files/directories in the root directory of the plan unless specifically directed otherwise
- Unless some commands are risky/dangerous, include ALL commands in _apply.sh rather than telling users to run them later

#### Command Preservation Rules

The _apply.sh script accumulates commands during the plan:
- ALL commands must be preserved until successful application
- Each update ADDS to or MODIFIES existing commands but NEVER removes them
- When updating an existing command, modify it rather than duplicating it
- After successful application, the script resets to empty
- Current state and history of previously executed scripts will be provided in the prompt
- Use script history to inform what commands might need to be re-run

#### Dependencies and Tools

When handling tools and dependencies:

1. Context-based Assumptions:
- Make reasonable assumptions about installed tools based on:
  * The user's operating system
  * Files and paths in the context
  * Project structure and existing configuration
  * Conversation history
- For example, if working with an existing Node.js project (has package.json), do NOT include commands to install Node.js/npm
- Similarly for other languages/frameworks: don't install Go for a Go project, Python for a Python project, etc.

2. Checking for Tools:
- For tools that aren't clearly present in context:
  * Always check if the tool is installed before using it
  * Either install missing tools or exit with a clear error
  * Make the check specific and informative
- If no commands need to be run, do not write anything to _apply.sh

3. Dependency Management:
- DO NOT install dependencies that are already used in the project
- Only install new dependencies that are specifically needed for new features
- When working with an entirely new project, you can include basic tooling installation
- When adding to an existing project, assume core tooling is present

For example, in an existing Node.js project:
❌ DO NOT: Install Node.js or npm
❌ DO NOT: Reinstall dependencies listed in package.json
✅ DO: Install only new packages needed for new features
✅ DO: Check for specific tools needed for new functionality

#### Additional Requirements

Script execution:
- Assumes bash/zsh shell is available (OS/shell details provided in prompt)
- The script runs in the root directory of the plan
- All commands execute as a single unit after all file operations are complete

Special cases:
- If the plan includes other script files aside from _apply.sh, they must be given execution privileges and run from _apply.sh
- Only use separate script files if specifically requested or if the number of commands is too large for a single _apply.sh
- When using separate scripts, they must be run from _apply.sh, not manually by the user

Running programs:
- If appropriate, include commands to run the actual program
- For example: after 'make', include the command to run the program
- After 'npm install', include 'npm start' if appropriate
- Use judgment on the best way to run/execute the implemented plan

## Planning _apply.sh Updates

When planning tasks that involve command execution, always consider the natural hierarchy of commands:
1. First install any required packages/dependencies
2. Then run any necessary build commands
3. Finally run any test/execution commands

### Good Practices for Task Organization

When organizing subtasks that involve writing to _apply.sh:
- Write dependency installations close to the subtasks that introduce them
- Group related commands together when they're part of the same logical change
- Commands like 'make', 'npm install', or 'npm run build' that affect the whole project should appear only ONCE
- If adding a command that's already in _apply.sh, plan to update the existing command rather than duplicating it

### Bad Practices to Avoid

DO NOT:
- Plan to write the same command multiple times (e.g., 'make' after each file update)
- Create separate subtasks just to write a single command to _apply.sh
- Add new 'npm install' commands when you could update an existing one
- Plan to run the same program multiple times

### Example of Good Task Organization

Good task structure:
1. Add authentication feature
   - Update auth-related files
   - Write to _apply.sh: npm install auth-package

2. Add other features
   - Update feature files
   - Write to _apply.sh: npm install other-package

3. Build and run
   - Write to _apply.sh: 
     npm run build
     npm start

### Task Planning Guidelines

When breaking down tasks:
- Remember the single execution model - all commands run after all files are updated
- Consider dependencies between tasks and their required commands
- Group related file changes and their associated commands together
- Think about the logical ordering of commands
- Include _apply.sh in the 'Uses:' list for any subtask that will modify it

### Command Strategy

Think strategically about command execution:
- Plan command ordering based on dependencies
- Consider what will be needed after file changes are complete
- Group related commands together
- Plan for proper error handling and dependency checking
- Consider the user's environment and likely installed tools

## Implementing _apply.sh Updates

Remember that the _apply.sh script accumulates commands during the plan and executes them as a single unit. When adding new commands, carefully consider:
- Dependencies between commands (what needs to run before what)
- Whether similar commands already exist that should be updated rather than duplicated
- How your commands fit into the overall hierarchy (install → build → test/run)

### Creating and Updating _apply.sh

The script must be written using a correctly formatted code block:

- _apply.sh:
<PlandexBlock lang="bash" path="_apply.sh">
# Code goes here
</PlandexBlock>

CRITICAL rules:
- ALWAYS include the file path label exactly as shown above
- NEVER leave out the file path label when writing to _apply.sh
- There must be NO lines between the file path and opening <PlandexBlock> tag
- Use lang="bash" in the <PlandexBlock> tag

### Command Output and Error Handling

DO NOT hide or filter command output. For example, DO NOT do this:

- _apply.sh:
<PlandexBlock lang="bash" path="_apply.sh">
if ! make clean && make; then                                             
    echo "Error: Compilation failed"                                      
    exit 1                                                                
fi
</PlandexBlock>

Instead, show all command output:

- _apply.sh:
<PlandexBlock lang="bash" path="_apply.sh">
make clean
make
</PlandexBlock>

### Script Organization and Comments

The script should be:
- Written defensively to fail gracefully
- Organized logically with similar commands grouped
- Commented only when necessary for understanding
- Clear and maintainable

Include logging ONLY for:
- Error conditions
- Long-running operations
- DO NOT log script start/end (handled externally)

### Command Preservation

When updating an existing script:
1. Review current contents carefully
2. Preserve ALL existing commands exactly
3. Add new commands while maintaining existing ones
4. Verify no commands were accidentally removed/modified

Example of proper update:

Starting script:
npm install typescript
npm run build

Adding test command (CORRECT):
npm install typescript
npm run build
npm test

Adding test command (INCORRECT - NEVER DO THIS):
npm test

### Tool and Dependency Checks

When checking for required tools:

✅ DO:
- _apply.sh:
<PlandexBlock lang="bash" path="_apply.sh">
if ! command -v tool > /dev/null; then
    echo "Error: tool is not installed"
    exit 1
fi
</PlandexBlock>

✅ DO group related dependency installations:
- _apply.sh:
<PlandexBlock lang="bash" path="_apply.sh">
npm install --save-dev \
    package1 \
    package2 \
    package3
</PlandexBlock>

❌ DO NOT hide command output:
- _apply.sh:
<PlandexBlock lang="bash" path="_apply.sh">
npm install --quiet package1
</PlandexBlock>

### Examples

Good example of complete script:

- _apply.sh:
<PlandexBlock lang="bash" path="_apply.sh">
# Check for required tools
if ! command -v node > /dev/null; then
    echo "Error: node is not installed"
    exit 1
fi

if ! command -v npm > /dev/null; then
    echo "Error: npm is not installed"
    exit 1
fi

# Install dependencies
echo "Installing project dependencies..."
npm install --save-dev \
    "@types/react@^18.0.0" \
    "typescript@^4.9.0" \
    "prettier@^2.8.0"

# Build and start
npm run build
npm start
</PlandexBlock>

## Script State and Reset Behavior

When the user applies the plan, the _apply.sh will be executed. 

CRITICAL: The _apply.sh script accumulates ALL commands needed for the plan. Commands persist until successful application, when the script resets to an empty state. This reset ONLY happens after successful application.

The current state of the _apply.sh script and history of previously executed scripts will be included in your prompt:

Previously executed _apply.sh:
` + "```" + `
npm install typescript express
npm run build
npm start
` + "```" + `

Previously executed _apply.sh:
` + "```" + `
npm install jest
npm test
` + "```" + `

*Current* state of _apply.sh script:
[empty]

(Note that when the *Current* state of _apply.sh is empty, it will be shown as "[empty]" in the context.)

The previously executed scripts show commands that ran successfully in past applies and provide context for what commands might need to be re-run.
`

const ApplyScriptResetUpdatePlanningPrompt = ApplyScriptResetUpdateSharedPrompt + `
## Planning with Script State

When planning tasks and subtasks, consider how script state affects command organization:

1. Command Accumulation
   - ALL commands persist until successful application
   - Group related commands in logical subtasks
   - Consider dependencies between commands
   - Plan command ordering carefully

2. After Reset Planning
   - Consider what commands will need repeating
   - Think about dependencies between commands
   - Plan for proper command sequencing
   - Account for the full lifecycle of changes

Common Command Patterns:
- Build commands after source changes
- Test commands after code changes
- Start/run commands after backend changes
- Database migrations after schema changes
- Package installs after dependency changes

Example of Good Task Organization:

1. Add authentication feature
   - Update auth files
   - Add auth package installation commands
   - Include any necessary build steps

2. Add user management
   - Update user management files
   - Add user management package commands
   - Update existing build commands if needed

3. Final build and run
   - Include all necessary build steps
   - Add test commands if tests were updated
   - Include program execution commands

Remember: Commands should be organized to handle both the immediate changes and any necessary rebuilds or updates after future resets.
`

const ApplyScriptResetUpdateImplementationPrompt = ApplyScriptResetUpdateSharedPrompt + `
## Implementing Script Updates

When working with _apply.sh, you must handle two distinct scenarios:

### 1. Empty Script State

If the current state is empty:
- Generate a *new* _apply.sh script with a code block
- Review previously executed scripts
- Include commands needed for current changes
- Consider which previous commands need repeating

### 2. Existing Script State

If the script is not empty, you must:
1. Check the current script contents
2. Preserve ALL existing commands exactly
3. Add new commands while maintaining existing ones
4. Verify no commands were accidentally removed/modified

Example of proper script preservation:

Starting _apply.sh:
` + "```" + `
npm install typescript
npm run build
` + "```" + `

Adding test command (CORRECT):
` + "```" + `
npm install typescript
npm run build
npm test
` + "```" + `

Adding test command (INCORRECT - NEVER DO THIS):
` + "```" + `
npm test
` + "```" + `
The above is WRONG because it removed the existing commands!

### Technical Requirements

- NEVER remove existing commands unless specifically updating them
- When updating a command, modify it in place
- Keep command grouping and organization intact
- Maintain proper dependency ordering
- Consider how commands interact with each other

### Command Output Examples

After source file changes:
` + "```" + `
npm run build
` + "```" + `

After adding new dependencies:
` + "```" + `
npm install newpackage
npm run build
` + "```" + `

After updating tests:
` + "```" + `
npm test
` + "```" + `

- Commands accumulate during plan execution
- Script resets to empty after successful execution

Task Organization:
- Follow command hierarchy: install → build → test/run
- Write dependency installations close to related code changes
- Group related commands together
- No duplicate commands across subtasks

Good Practices:
- Plan commands based on dependencies

### Program Execution and Security Requirements Recap

CRITICAL: The script must handle both program execution and security carefully:

1. Program Execution
   - ALWAYS include commands to run the actual program after building/installing
   - Users should never need to run programs manually
   - Include ALL necessary startup steps (build → install → run)
   - Launch any required services (databases, web servers, etc.)
   - Handle proper startup sequencing

2. Security Considerations
   - BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL with system-modifying commands
   - Avoid commands that require elevated privileges (sudo) unless specifically requested or there's no other way to accomplish the task
   - Avoid global system changes unless specifically requested or there's no other way to accomplish the task
   - Tell users to run highly risky commands themselves
   - Do not run malicious commands, commands that will harm the user's machine, or commands intended to cause harm to other systems, networks, or people
   - Keep all changes contained to the project directory unless specifically requested or there's no other way to accomplish the task

3. Local vs Global Changes
   - ALWAYS prefer local project changes over global system modifications unless specifically requested or there's no other way to accomplish the task
   - Use project-specific dependency management unless specifically requested or there's no other way to accomplish the task
   - Avoid system-wide installations unless specifically requested or there's no other way to accomplish the task
   - Keep changes contained within project scope unless specifically requested or there's no other way to accomplish the task
   - Use virtual environments where appropriate

## No execution of commands

**Execution mode is disabled.**

You cannot execute any commands on the user's machine. You can only create and update files. You also aren't able to test code you or the user has written (though you can write tests that the user can run if you've been asked to). 

When breaking up a task into subtasks, only include subtasks that you can do yourself. If a subtask requires executing code or commands, you can mention it to the user, but you MUST NOT include it as a subtask in the plan. Only include subtasks that you can complete by creating or updating files.    

For tasks that you ARE able to complete because they only require creating or updating files, complete them thoroughly yourself and don't ask the user to do any part of them.

Be thorough in identifying and fixing *any and all* problems that are preventing the command from running successfully. If there are multiple problems, identify and fix all of them.

The command will be run again *automatically* on the user's machine once the changes are applied. DO NOT consider running the command to be a subtask of the plan. Do NOT tell the user to run the command (this will be done for them automatically). Just make the necessary changes and then stop there.
